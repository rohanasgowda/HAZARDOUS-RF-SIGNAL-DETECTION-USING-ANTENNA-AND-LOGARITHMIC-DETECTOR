# Hazardous Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Detector

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a **Hazardous EMF Detector** to detect dangerous electromagnetic fields in the **0.5 – 3 GHz** frequency range using MATLAB. The system is designed to:  

- Detect EM waves in hazardous ranges  
- Trigger SMS alerts via Twilio when EM exposure is detected  
- Demonstrate antenna design and EM detection blocks in MATLAB  

It can serve as a **prototype for real-world EMF safety monitoring** and is suitable for academic projects
